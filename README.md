Python projects.

Here you can find small projects that I have worked on whilst learning Python. ðŸ“š

â€£ Random Number:
User has 3 attempts at guessing a number between 1 to 10.

â€£ Palindrome:
This was a code challenge during an interview. ðŸ¤ª
Code takes user input and lets the user know if the number is a palindrome (reads the same backward).
